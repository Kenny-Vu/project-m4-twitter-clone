# Twitter Project

12:07am - 04 Aug, 2020
Hi, here's my submission for the React project. Here are some useful infos to navigate through this project.

### Basic Requirements Fulfilled:

- View a single tweet
- View a "home feed"
- View a profile page
- Liking a tweet
- Posting a new tweet

### Additional Requirements and Gotchas finished as well:

- Tweet Components
- Click targets
- Retweets show who it was retweeted from.
- Character limit
- Error screens
- Loading states
- Time displays
- Refetching after tweeting

### Other infos:

- I took the liberty of changing all cats to ducks because ducks are cuter.
- I changed display names and statuses in the server/data.js file
- The users' handles were not modified since the initial code for the server uses them so one duck will unfortunately have the handle name of "giantcat9".

### Things I will try to improve before the project is graded:

- The CSS could be better.
- Refactor some repeated code blocks and make it more DRY.
- Group related components into a folders.
- change some functions into custom hooks and have them in seperate files.
- add useContext hooks instead of prop drilling and vice-versa.
